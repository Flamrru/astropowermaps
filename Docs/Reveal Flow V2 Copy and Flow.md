LOADING SCREENS

Visual Layout
Full screen (not a popup)
Layer 1: Cosmic nebula background (same as previous screens)
Layer 2: Matrix-style code lines running down screen (faded, ~20% opacity) — NASA mission control aesthetic
Layer 3: Single brighter status line in center, updating with each message
Message Sequence
Each message displays for ~0.8 seconds (total: ~5-6 seconds)
"Converting birth time to UTC..." (technical)
"Calculating planetary positions at your birth..." (technical)
"Most people never see this map." (emotional)
"Mapping celestial bodies to geographic lines..." (technical)
"Finding where your energy naturally amplifies..." (emotional/benefit)
"Matching your lines to 100+ world cities..." (technical)
"Discovering what you've been missing..." (emotional)

Screen 8: 2026 Forecast Generation Loading
Visual Layout
Same as Screen 2 — full screen, nebula + matrix code + centered status line
Message Sequence
Each message displays for ~0.8 seconds (total: ~4-5 seconds)
"Scanning 2026 planetary transits..." (technical)
"This is the year everything can shift." (emotional)
"Finding your power months..." (benefit)
"Calculating when to move vs. when to wait..." (benefit)
"Your first power window might be sooner than you think..." (urgency/emotional)

Timing
Auto-advances to next screen when sequence completes
No user interaction required



Screen 3: Map Reveal 

Current Problems
Too zoomed in — The map shows too narrow a view. Users can't see the full scope of their lines crossing the planet.


Disappears too quickly — Currently auto-advances, giving no time for the "wow" moment to sink in.


Generic copy — "Your Birth Chart / The sky at your birth — mapped to Earth" doesn't feel personal or create emotional impact.



What We Want
Map Behavior:
Starts zoomed in on their birth location (so they see "this is where I was born")
Over 2-3 seconds, smoothly zooms out to show the entire planet
All 40 lines become visible, crossing continents, intersecting at various points
The zoom-out creates the "holy shit, this is everywhere" moment
Map does NOT auto-advance — it stays until user clicks
User Control:
User must click a button to proceed to the onboarding/explanation screens
This gives them time to absorb, explore mentally, feel the weight of what they're seeing
The button should feel inviting/glowing — prompting them forward when ready

Copy Options for Main Screen

This is your cosmic fingerprint.
Every line. Every crossing. Every place where something in you resonates with somewhere on Earth. 
Notice where the lines cross…


Button Copy Options
The button should feel like an invitation, not a task. It's prompting curiosity, not work.
 "What am I seeing? →"

Button Visual Treatment
Subtle glow or pulse animation to draw attention
Appears after the zoom-out animation completes (not immediately)
Positioned at bottom of screen, doesn't obstruct the map
Gold accent color consistent with rest of flow





INTERMEDIARY SCREENS (after map reveal up to the 2026 report)

I'm not sure about the map being in the background. It's too much faded right now, so it's like there is no value in seeing it. It either needs to be brighter or the pop-up screen should just be the full screen.

│  │     Very. Your power months are based on planetary        │  │
│  │     transits which don't require exact time. City         │  │
│  │     recommendations may shift slightly, but the core      │  │

│  │     No. This is calculated using your exact birth data    │  │
│  │     and NASA-grade ephemeris coordinates. Two people      │  │
