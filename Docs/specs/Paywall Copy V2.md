Testimonials
What people are saying
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"I was about to send a resignation email on a 19-score day. Stella told me to wait. Sent it on a 78-score day instead — got a counteroffer I didn't expect. Same email. Different day. Different outcome."
— Marcus L., Chicago

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Booked a trip to my #1 power city on a whim. Met my now-business partner in a hotel lobby. I'm not saying it's magic — but I'm not saying it isn't."
— Sarah M., London

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"My 'worst month' was March. I had already planned to launch then. Pushed it to May — my #2 power month. Best decision I made all year."
— James T., Toronto


How It Works Block (Collapsible/Expandable)
How we calculate your map
When you entered your birth data, we didn't pull a generic chart.
We converted your birth moment to a Julian Day number — the same system astronomers use. Then we calculated exactly where each of the 10 planets was in the sky at that instant using VSOP87 theory (Variational Secular Perturbation — fancy name, NASA-grade accuracy).
From there, we computed 40 lines showing where each planet was rising, setting, at its highest point, and its lowest — and matched them against 338 cities worldwide.
Your power months? We analyzed every single day of 2026, checking when transiting planets form exact angles to your natal positions. Tighter angles = stronger score.
Result: A map that's yours and only yours.

FAQ Section
Title: "People often ask"
Question
Answer
How accurate is this if I don't know my exact birth time?
Very. Your power months are based on planetary transits which don't require exact time. City recommendations may shift slightly, but the core insights remain accurate.
Is this just generic horoscope stuff?
No. We use VSOP87 — the same planetary algorithm NASA uses — to calculate your exact birth sky. Your 40 lines are computed to sub-degree precision. Two people born one day apart have completely different maps. This isn't 'you're a Scorpio, so...' — this is real astronomical math applied to your specific coordinates in space-time.
What if I can't travel to my power cities?
You don't need to move there. Even virtual connections to those places — collaborating with people from that region, or planning a future trip — can activate the energy. The cities are compass points, not requirements.
Do I get instant access?
Yes. Immediately after purchase, everything unlocks instantly — your map, your forecast, Stella, daily scores. All of it.
What happens after my trial?
Your subscription continues at $19.99/month. Cancel anytime with one tap — no calls, no hassle.
Does the content update?
Yes. Your daily score, journal prompts, and transit tracking update every day. Stella is always available. This isn't a static PDF — it's a living tool.
