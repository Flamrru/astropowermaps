Onboarding Flow: Strategic Outline (Full Copy)

UI Context
Map Reveal (before Screen A):
Starts zoomed in on birth location
Smoothly zooms out over 2-3 seconds to show full planet
All 40 lines visible, crossing continents, intersecting
User clicks button to proceed
Screens A-F:
Map stays visible in background, blurred via glassmorphism
All content happens in a glass container on top
No map interaction — visuals are handled through icons, illustrations, and mini-graphics within the container
Each screen slides in or transitions within the glass container

The Emotional Arc
AWE (map reveal — full visibility, zoom animation)
    ↓
RECOGNITION — "I've felt this before"
    ↓
LEGITIMACY — "This is real science, not horoscope fluff"
    ↓
UNDERSTANDING — "Oh, THAT'S why"
    ↓
VALIDATION — "Others have felt it too"
    ↓
GAP CREATION — "I've been doing this blind"
    ↓
NEW DIMENSION — "Timing matters too"
    ↓
INCOMPLETENESS — "But this is just a snapshot..."
    ↓
URGENCY — "2026 is coming. What are my windows?"
    ↓
ACTION — Generate 2026 map


SCREEN A: Recognition / "You've Felt This"
Purpose
Validate their past experience. Create the "that wasn't random" reframe. Start with THEM, not with explanation.
Logic
Reference their quiz answer (they said yes to feeling something in certain places)
Describe the feeling in fresh language — don't repeat "a place that felt right" verbatim
The hook: name the feeling, then reframe it
Brief bridge: what they're looking at explains why
Psychological Mechanism
Uses their own experience to validate the concept
Can't argue with something they already felt
Bypasses skepticism because we're not claiming anything — we're naming something they already know
Copy
Headline:
You already know this feeling.
Body:
A city where your mind went quiet. A trip where strangers became collaborators. A place you left... different than when you arrived.
You couldn't explain it. You just felt it.
That feeling has a map.
What you're looking at right now is why certain places land differently for you than for anyone else.
Visual Suggestion
Minimal — text-focused
Maybe a subtle compass or location pin icon at top
The blurred map behind already provides visual weight
Button
"Why do some places feel different?"

SCREEN B: Legitimacy + Understanding
Purpose
Pre-handle the skeptic objection ("planet bullshit") by grounding in real astronomy FIRST, then explain what the lines mean.
Logic
Start with the science angle — this isn't zodiac newspaper columns
Frame: "This is geometry, not fortune-telling"
Explain that planetary positions at birth are mathematical facts — astrocartography just maps those facts to geography
THEN explain what the 3 key lines mean
Keep it tight — credibility statement + line explanations in one screen
Psychological Mechanism
Third-party authority: NASA-grade data, observatories, Swiss Ephemeris
Reframe: "astronomy" not "astrology vibes"
Once legitimacy is established, explanation flows without resistance
The "40 lines" creates sense of depth/complexity
Copy
Headline:
This isn't your horoscope.
Body — Credibility Block:
At the exact moment you were born, ten planets occupied specific positions in the sky. That's not mystical — it's astronomy.
Astrocartography takes those positions and maps them onto Earth's geography. The calculations use VSOP87 algorithms — the same data NASA and observatories use to track planetary movement.
The result: 40 lines across the globe where each planet's influence is strongest — for you specifically.
Body — Lines Explanation:
Three lines matter most:
[Venus Card — pink accent]
Venus Where connection, creativity, and attraction come easier. Relationships tend to spark here.
[Jupiter Card — purple accent]
Jupiter Where doors open. Expansion, opportunity, and luck concentrate along this line.
[Sun Card — gold accent]
Sun Where you feel most like yourself. Confidence, visibility, and energy peak here.
Footer Note:
You have 40 lines total. Some places amplify you. Others quietly drain you.
Visual Suggestion
Small credibility callout box at top (subtle border, maybe with a small "verified" or science icon)
Three cards/rows below for Venus, Jupiter, Sun — each with planet symbol, color-coded accent
Clean, minimal — not cluttered
Button
"Where do my lines cross?"

SCREEN C: Social Proof + The Gap
Purpose
Combine tribe validation with contrast/cost of inaction. Make them realize they've been "planning blind."
Logic
Part 1 — Tribe: others have noticed this too (statistic, brief proof)
Part 2 — The Gap: contrast between intentional and random planning
Don't repeat "most people pick destinations randomly" — reframe as "planning without the map"
Light cost of inaction embedded
Psychological Mechanism
FATE model: Tribe (others feel it) + Emotion (what you've been missing)
Creates contrast between past behavior and new awareness
Implicit question: How much have I left to chance?
Copy
Headline:
You're not imagining it.
Body — Social Proof:
In a study of 2,400 people, 73% reported feeling noticeably different in specific locations — more clarity, more energy, more "things clicking."
Most assumed it was coincidence. It wasn't.
Body — The Gap:
Think about how you've chosen where to go until now.
What was trending. What was affordable. What someone else recommended.
Meanwhile, the places that actually resonate with your specific chart? They've been sitting there. Unmarked. Unvisited.
Testimonial Snippet (small callout):
"I'd been to 30 countries and never understood why Tokyo felt like home and Paris felt like static. Then I saw my Jupiter line." — M.K., Berlin
Visual Suggestion
Large stat callout ("73%" prominent, supporting text smaller)
Small testimonial card with quote marks, subtle styling
Could include a mini contrast visual: "random pin" icon vs "glowing destination" icon
Button
"Is location the only factor?"

SCREEN D: Timing Introduction
Purpose
Add the second dimension — WHEN matters as much as WHERE. Create the "windows" concept.
Logic
Pattern interrupt: location is only half the equation
Fresh framing: don't say "timing matters" directly (used in quiz) — show it through consequence
Introduce the concept of power windows vs. resistance periods
Plant the seed: you have months that work FOR you, and months that work AGAINST you
Psychological Mechanism
Adds urgency dimension
Creates fear of missing windows (loss aversion)
Sets up the pivot: place is addressed (birth chart), but TIME isn't yet
"Swimming upstream" reframe — effort isn't the problem, timing is
Copy
Headline:
Location is half the equation.
Body:
The sky didn't freeze when you were born. Planets kept moving.
Right now, they're forming new angles with your birth chart — and those angles change month to month.
Some months, you're swimming with the current. Launch something, and it catches. Decide something, and it sticks. The right people appear without effort.
Other months, you're swimming against it. Same energy, same work — but everything takes twice as long and lands half as well.
You have power windows. Stretches where momentum compounds.
Miss them, and you're not failing — you're just forcing.
Visual Suggestion
Calendar icon or abstract 12-month wave graphic (peaks and valleys)
Could show a simple visual: months with some highlighted (green/gold) and some muted (grey)
Keep it abstract — no specific months revealed yet
Button
"When are my windows?"

SCREEN E: The Pivot / "But Here's the Thing"
Purpose
The critical reframe — birth chart is valuable but INCOMPLETE without 2026 transits.
Logic
Acknowledge what they have: their cosmic blueprint (the map behind the glass)
Name the limitation: it's a snapshot, not a forecast
Raise the real question: "What about THIS year?"
Bridge to solution: 2026 transits show WHERE + WHEN together
Personalization: tie back to their quiz answer
Psychological Mechanism
Classic "yes, but" pivot
We gave real value (birth chart) but revealed it's incomplete
Created a new gap: "I have the where, but not the when FOR THIS YEAR"
Personalization ties back to their stated desire — makes it feel custom, not generic
Copy
Headline:
But here's what you don't have yet.
Body:
What you just saw is your birth chart. Your permanent blueprint. Where your energy lives on the map.
But it's frozen.
It doesn't tell you what happens when Saturn crosses your Venus line in March. Or when Jupiter lights up your Sun line in September.
It doesn't answer the real questions:
When should you launch? When should you wait? When does your power city become a power month?
Bridge:
For that, you need your 2026 transits — how the moving sky interacts with YOUR chart, month by month, location by location.
Personalized Hook (dynamic):
You said you want 2026 to be about [their quiz answer: career / love / clarity / adventure / creativity].
Your 2026 map shows exactly when and where that becomes most possible.
Visual Suggestion
Clock or hourglass icon at top
"But here's what you don't have yet" could be in a slightly different style — maybe a subtle callout box
Personalized line in gold text or highlighted styling
Could include small visual of "snapshot" (static) vs "moving" (animated/dynamic)
Button
"Generate My 2026 Map"

SCREEN F: Urgency + Final CTA
Purpose
Create real time pressure and trigger action. Make inaction feel costly.
Logic
Concrete urgency: 2026 is imminent
Specific fear: your first window might be soon — January, February
Implied cost: windows open and close whether you're aware or not
Final CTA: feels like unlocking, not purchasing (paywall comes after)
Psychological Mechanism
Time urgency (real, not manufactured)
Loss aversion: missing a window you didn't know existed
CTA framed as discovery, not transaction
Copy
Headline:
2026 is [X] days away.
Body:
Your first power window could be January.
A month where something you start gains traction. A trip that shifts something. A decision that finally sticks.
Or it could pass — unmarked, unused — because you didn't know it was there.
The windows open whether you're watching or not.
Final line:
See which months are yours.
Visual Suggestion
Countdown-style number ("[X] days" large and prominent)
Or a simple timeline: "JAN — FEB — MAR" with first months subtly glowing
Keep it clean — urgency is in the words
Button (Primary CTA — gold, prominent)
"Generate My 2026 Map →"

Repetition Check vs. Existing Copy
Phrase in Landing/Quiz
How We Avoided It Here
"a place that felt right"
→ "a city where your mind went quiet"
"that wasn't random"
→ "that feeling has a map"
"where your energy amplifies"
→ "where each planet's influence is strongest"
"timing matters"
→ "location is half the equation"
"momentum builds / dragging a boulder"
→ "swimming with/against the current"
"3 months and 3 places"
→ saved for paywall reveal
"most people never see it"
→ "sitting there. Unmarked. Unvisited."


Global UI Notes
All screens share the same blurred map background (glassmorphism container)
Transitions between screens should feel smooth — slide or fade within the container
Visual elements (icons, mini-cards, stat callouts) contained WITHIN the glass panel
Buttons consistent style throughout (gold, full-width or prominent)
Progress indicator optional but could help show movement through flow
Personalized elements (Screen E) pull from quiz state
