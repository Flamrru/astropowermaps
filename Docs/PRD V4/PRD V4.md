Current problematic sequence:
Quiz Screen 8: Loading ("Checking if your map is ready...") — but there's no map yet, no birth data given
Quiz Screen 9: Email capture only
Quiz Screen 10: Confirmation "You're In" + click to continue
Reveal Step 1: Birth data form (date, time, city)
Reveal Step 2: Another loading screen
That's five screens between the emotional peak (testimonial) and the payoff (map reveal). Three of them involve user input or waiting. The psychological momentum from the quiz bleeds out.

The Core Issue
The first loading screen is incongruent — it says "checking if your map is ready" when no birth data has been entered. The brain registers this mismatch even if consciously they don't articulate it. Then you ask for email, confirm they're "in," ask them to click AGAIN, then ask for MORE data, then make them wait AGAIN.
From the Behavior Ops principles: each new screen requiring action is a decision point where people can drop. You want the sunk cost from 7 quiz screens to carry them through ONE data capture moment, not fragment it across multiple steps.

The Fix: Consolidate Into One Capture Moment
Remove:
Quiz Screen 8 (fake loading)
Quiz Screen 10 (confirmation/transition)
Reveal Step 1 (separate birth form)
Combine into ONE screen: Email + Birth Data captured together, immediately after the testimonial.
New flow:
Quiz Screen 7: Testimonial (emotional peak)
NEW Screen 8: Combined Capture (email + birth data in one form)
NEW Screen 9: Real Loading (astrocartography calculation — this one is earned)
Screen 10 → becomes the Map Reveal (the payoff)
Then continue with onboarding, pivot, 2026 generation, paywall as designed.

NEW Screen 8: Combined Capture
This screen needs to:
Feel like the natural next step (not a new ask)
Frame the birth data as the key to personalization (not an obstacle)
Capture everything in one decisive action
Maintain the emotional momentum
Visual Elements
Same cosmic background/video continuity as quiz
Glassmorphism card containing the form
Progress indicator showing near-completion (85-90%)
Sparkles or subtle celebratory element (they're close!)
Single powerful CTA button

Why This Works
From the Behavior Ops framework:
Compliance momentum: They've answered 7 screens of questions. One more form feels like continuation, not escalation.
Sunk cost activation: Investment is highest RIGHT after testimonial. That's when to ask for the bigger commitment.
Cognitive load bundling: Asking for email + birth data together feels like "one thing" rather than "two separate asks."
Congruence: The next loading screen is now REAL — actually calculating their chart. No fake waiting, no mismatch.
From conversion psychology:
The people who make it to Screen 8 are pre-qualified by the quiz. They WANT the map. The birth data is the price of admission they're ready to pay.
Separating email and birth data creates two moments of "do I really want to do this?" — combining them creates ONE decisive moment.

NEW Screen 9: Loading (Real Calculation)
This replaces both the old fake loading AND the reveal loading. One loading screen, doing real work.
Duration: 5-6 seconds
Visual Elements:
3D wireframe globe rotating
Planetary lines drawing across the globe (Sun = gold, Venus = pink, Jupiter = purple, Mars = red)
Progress bar filling
Calculation readout showing real-looking data
Rotating Messages (every 0.8 seconds):
1. "Converting birth time to UTC..."
2. "Calculating planetary positions at your birth moment..."
3. "This is unique to you — no one else has this map."
4. "Mapping celestial bodies to geographic lines..."
5. "Finding where your energy naturally amplifies..."
6. "Matching your lines to 100+ world cities..."
7. "Almost ready..."

The key change: Message 3 is new — "This is unique to you — no one else has this map." This reinforces that the waiting is because something REAL and PERSONAL is being created. It's worth the wait.

NEW Screen 10: Confirmation + Soft Transition
After the loading completes, instead of going directly to the map reveal, you have a brief (2-3 second) confirmation moment that sets up what they're about to see.
Auto-advances after 2.5 seconds (no button required)
Visual:
Gold checkmark animation
Subtle celebration particles
Text fading in
Copy:
✓ Your map is ready.

[Auto-transitions to map reveal]

This serves as a "breath" before the big reveal — creates the "holy shit" moment when the map appears.
